$< ClassicZoo dev >

+ Editor improvements.
  + Syntax highlighting can now be turned
    on/off.

$< ClassicZoo 4.30 >

+ Super ClassicZoo has now been merged
  into ClassicZoo! This means that many
  improvements and bugfixes from each
  codebase have made its way to both.
  + In particular, this means Super
    ClassicZoo now has PC-9801, SDL2
    and Amiga ports!
+ Editor improvements.
  + [SDL2] Press Alt+arrows to move
    faster on the board.
  + Board reordering - use -/+
    in the board selection menu!
  + Stats list - Ctrl+S; use -/+
    to reorder stats.
  + Board info menu now displays the
    board size in bytes.
  + Config option to make the starting
    board editable separately ([W]).
  + Config option and menu for low-level
    tile/stat editing.
  * Board deletion is now done by
    pressing DEL in the board list.
  * The user is now prevented from
    trying to provide out-of-bounds
    max shots values.
+ [DOS, PC-98] Support changing blink
  modes in the options menu.
+ [SDL2] Built-in Museum of ZZT client.
* The file selection window no longer
  animates when changing directories.
/ [Amiga] Fix regressions.
/ [SDL2] Fix sticky modifier keys.
/ {SuperZ} Fix scrolling behaviour.

$< ClassicZoo 4.22 >

+ Added "Reduced messages" config option,
  equivalent to CleanZZT/CleenZZT.
+ Added "Neuromotor assist" config
  option, inspired by WiL's AccZZT.
+ Added "Help" option to the options
  menu.

$< ClassicZoo 4.21 >

+ [SDL2] Added config option to change
  blinking behaviour.
/ [SDL2] Very minor engine accuracy
  and stability improvements.

$< ClassicZoo 4.20 >

+ Experimental SDL2 port! This allows
  running ClassicZoo natively on various
  "modern" machines - in particular,
  Linux and Windows have been tested.
  This port unlocks many improvements,
  such as vastly improved input code,
  gamepad support, configuring animation
  speed, and more!
+ Experimental Amiga port! No sound yet,
  but... you can play ZZT on Amiga now,
  I guess?
+ Configuration system! ClassicZoo will
  now remember your config options and
  allow you to change them from an in-
  game menu.
+ [DOS] Added a "/SAFEV" parameter for
  compatibility, which disables direct
  video access. Quite slow, though!
+ Editor improvements.
  + Added option to configure KevEdit-
    style "auto-append" of patterns.
  + Added reporting object code to
    ?DEBUG/?DCOMPAT/?DUNDEF messages.
  / Fixed invisible/board edge tiles
    becoming invisible after creating
    a new world.
/ Fixed a crash in text window code.
/ Fixed unnecessary fade to red on
  successful world load.

$< ClassicZoo 4.17 >

+ Add Options menu! So far, this menu
  features:
  + Compatibility toggle! "Strict" forces
    emulating certain ZZT bugs which make
    some games run less reliably, but are
    required by a few titles (Phoebus P.)
* Forced use of 8-dot-wide character mode
  on VGA cards.
* Minor filesize/CPU optimizations have
  been made to the engine.

$< ClassicZoo 4.16 >

+ Add /NOSNOW argument to disable CGA
  snow checks on machines which do not
  have the issue.
+ Add ?DUNDEF as a debug flag to check
  for undefined engine behaviour.
* Minor filesize/CPU optimizations have
  been made to the engine.
/ Fixed board selection dialogs not
  respecting exiting with ESC correctly.

  engine behaviour in the engine.

$< ClassicZoo 4.15 >

* Minor filesize/CPU optimizations have
  been made to the engine.

  of bounds and in an off-by-one way.
/ Fixed the NOCLIP cheat not working with
  board edges and when paused.

$< ClassicZoo 4.12 >

  within a single session, the position
  of the last opened file.
+ Editor improvements.
  + Added new elements to the F5 menu.
    . Blink rays.
    . Player clones.
    . Fake players.
    . Projectiles: bullets, stars.
  + PgUp/PgDn can now be used to browse
    boards.
  * Copying players, player clones and
    fake players is now allowed.
* Minor filesize/CPU optimizations have
  been made to the engine.
/ Fixed major crash bug involving boards
  above 20000 bytes.

  + Added support for opening and saving
    files in the code editor.

  . Pressing CTRL+V will now ask for
    confirmation before pasting.
  . Opening locked worlds now emits only
    a warning, while opening savefiles
    always emits one.
/ The engine will now try to gracefully
  recover the last board of "Super Lock"
  affected worlds.

$< ClassicZoo 4.10 >

+ NEC PC-9801 port! It's fairly barebones
  (relies on text mode, vastly limiting
  its color output), but 100% functional.
+ Board editor improvements.
  + Added support for cutting, copying
    and pasting board tiles.
+ Text/code editor improvements.
  + Added support for cutting, copying

  characters in the editor - press F10
  while typing.
+ Added support for using PgUp/PgDn in
  many choice-based sidebar prompts.
+ Allowed inputting longer board names -
  up to 42 characters in length.

  edited when the time limit was edited
  on the board information menu.

$< ClassicZoo 4.0 >

The first public release of ClassicZoo
contains the effects of the past year
of research into patches following the
release of the Reconstruction of ZZT.

+ EMS/XMS extended memory support. This
  effectively ends the ~350-400KB world
  size limit for anyone with extended
  memory. (Mr_Alert)
+ Dynamic IoTmpBuf size scaling. This
  effectively ends the 20000-byte board
  size limit. (If you want to keep your
  game ZZT 3.2-friendly, you can use
  DCOMPAT in the debug console to guard
  against oversized boards.)
+ New file selector, with support for
  directory traversal.
+ Enhanced editor:
  + New color picker - allows picking
    all 8 BG and all 16 FG colors.
  + D toggle - as in KevEdit, this will
    force usage of the user-picked color
    even if the ZZT default differs.
  + Added water to the default pattern
    list.
  + Added support for multiple pattern
    slots, complete with hotkeys.
  + Added F5 tab for advanced elements.
    Currently, this exposes board edges.
  * The Transfer -> Import option now
    uses the file selector to choose
    a board.
+ Revamped debug console handling. Many
  new commands! Use the newly added
  documentation ("?" command).
- Removed the slightly glitchy-on-more-
  modern-platforms player step sound.
- Removed the shareware/registered
  distinction and order messages.
* Many documentation improvements.
* Tons of CPU optimizations and memory
  usage improvements have been made.
* Tweaked video color handling for the
  monochrome mode.
/ Fixed the following ZZT 3.2 bugs.
  (Note that, in ClassicZoo, fixes are
  only done for game behaviour which
  leads to a crash or soft-lock - this
  is to preserve compatibility with
  existing games.)
  . Gameplay
    . Fixed conveyors swapping stats in
      some scenarios, which could lead
      to a game soft-lock (no player).
    . Fixed conveyors not rendering an
      item in some edge cases.
    . Fixed crash when a stat recursively
      pushed itself. (GreaseMonkey)
    . Fixed crash when a scroll executes
      #become or /dir. (GreaseMonkey)

      (zzo38)
    . Fixed various centipede edge cases.
      (Tim Sweeney - from Super ZZT)

      board information.
    . Fixed copying object code between
      boards.
    . Fixed editing pre-bound object
      code. (kristomu)
  . General
    . Fixed text window memory corruption
      for texts longer than 1024 lines.
/ Fixed an I/O error being shown if the
  startup world was not found.
