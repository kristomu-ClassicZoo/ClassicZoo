$< Super ClassicZoo 4.00 >

+ EMS/XMS extended memory support. This
  effectively ends the ~350-400KB world
  size limit for anyone with extended
  memory. (Mr_Alert)
+ Dynamic IoTmpBuf size scaling. This
  effectively ends the 20000-byte board
  size limit, bumping it to 65500 bytes.
+ New file selector, with support for
  directory traversal.
+ Enhanced editor from ClassicZoo 4.15
- Removed the slightly glitchy-on-more-
  modern-platforms player step sound.
- Removed the shareware/registered
  distinction and order messages.
* Many documentation improvements.
* Tons of CPU optimizations and memory
  usage improvements have been made.
/ Fixed the following Super ZZT bugs.
  (Note that, in ClassicZoo, fixes are
  only done for game behaviour which
  leads to a crash or soft-lock - this
  is to preserve compatibility with
  existing games.)
  . Gameplay
    . Fixed conveyors swapping stats in
      some scenarios, which could lead
      to a game soft-lock (no player).
    . Fixed conveyors not rendering an
      item in some edge cases.
    . Fixed crash when a stat recursively
      pushed itself. (GreaseMonkey)
    . Fixed 0-cycle transporter crash.
      (zzo38)
    . Fixed double frees in #BIND.
    . Fixed being unable to exit the game
      while paused by pressing Q.
  . Editor
    . Most of ClassicZoo's fixes.
  . General
    . Fixed text window memory corruption
      for texts longer than 1024 lines.
